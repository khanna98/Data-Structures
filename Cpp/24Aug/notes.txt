Merge Sort
==========
- Its based on Conquer and Divide Stragey.   
- In this we divide the given array into 2 equal half of sub-arrays.
- In Conquer we sort the 2 sub-arrays recurrsively using merge sort algorithm and then 
combine the sorted ubs-arrays into single sorted array.
- First we find the size of array and then find beg, end and mid respectively.
- After that divide the array until we get a single element.
